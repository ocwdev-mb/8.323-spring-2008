[Corrections Page](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~mpeskin/QFT.html) for the required textbook _Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_

[Weak Interactions](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hgeorgi/283.html) by Howard Georgi, Professor, Department of Physics, Harvard University

[Lectures on Quantum Field Theory](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dt281/qft.html) by Dr. David Tong, High Energy Particle Physics Group, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge

The Department of Physics at Harvard Universtity has made available video recordings of lectures by the late [Sidney Coleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Coleman) for his graduate course Quantum Field Theory. The [videos](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/events/videos/Phys253) were recorded during the 1975-1976 academic year. In additon, handwritten lecture notes of the lectures are available as transcribed by Brian Hill. Each scanned file is about 6.5 MB in size.

*   Part 1 ([PDF - 6.5 MB](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dt281/qft/col1.pdf))

*   Part 2 ([PDF - 6.4 MB](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dt281/qft/col2.pdf))

[Bryan Gin-ge Chen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5013) has produced a TeX version of about 11 lectures of the 28 lectures in Brian Hill's notes.
